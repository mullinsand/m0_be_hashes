# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  -Hash notation and whether to use : or =>
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  -Its going ok. I think I need to really work on a system for taking written notes to show the code properly. I need additional pens and colors to do this. Writing down all the commands is helping cement them in my mind. Also, for tasks that I don't do very often, I have an easy look back for them. I take the best notes when I'm by myself independently going through the information
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  -I typically try to solve a code on my own for a little bit but if I see a way to do it that hasn't been covered by the lesson already, I immediately go to google to teach myself that way.
